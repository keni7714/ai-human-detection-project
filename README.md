# 🕵🏽‍♀️ TextSleuth - AI vs Human Text Detection

This Streamlit web app detects whether a given piece of text is AI-generated or human-written using machine learning models. It was built for the course *Introduction to Large Language Models / Intro to AI Agents*.

---

## 📊 Features

* Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and AdaBoost classifiers
* TF-IDF vectorizer for feature extraction
* Preprocessing pipeline with stopword removal
* Interactive UI with single prediction, batch processing, and model comparison
* Visual confidence charts and prediction summaries

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Streamlit

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keni7714/ai-human-detection-project.git
cd ai-human-detection-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually:

```bash
pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk
```
